# MATLAB_Simulink_for_CAE
This repository contains my code of the practical course "Praktikum_MATLAB_Simulink_for_CAE" in the winter semester WS2021/22

In this practical course, I have learned MATLAB coding, data processing, control toolbox, statistics toolbox, optimization toolbox etc.
For the Simulink I have learned to build a control model and a Simscape multibody model. Besides, I've also learned to use the Stateflow chart.
